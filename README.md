# Gemma-MMA8451
Using a GEMMA microcontroller with a MMA8451 accelerometer to drive a WS2812 LED pixel strip.

DEVELOPMENT SUSPENDED

The GEMMA V2 I was using to develop this project got bricked a couple of weeks back trying to upload the latest revision of the code - it seems the V2 doesn't have sufficient capacity to hold enough code to both drive the LED strip and read the accelerometer.  
As such, I have switched to using an Arduino Micro instead. The Micro code is [in a separate repository.](https://github.com/G-Ambatte/Micro-MMA8451)
